<img src="../images/adobo.jpg">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Adobong Manok is a classic Filipino chicken dish simmered in a savory blend of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and black pepper. This easy-to-make recipe delivers tender, flavorful chicken with a rich, tangy sauce perfect for pairing with steamed rice. Simple, hearty, and deeply satisfying!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 kg chicken (cut into serving pieces)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>1/3 cup vinegar</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic (crushed)</li>
    <li>1 onion (optional, sliced)</li>
    <li>2–3 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 tsp whole black peppercorns</li>
    <li>1 tbsp brown sugar (optional, for a hint of sweetness)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water (adjust as needed)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp cooking oil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Marinate the chicken in soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and peppercorns for at least 30 minutes (or overnight for deeper flavor).</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Sauté the garlic (and onions if using) until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the marinated chicken (reserve the marinade) and sear until lightly browned on all sides.</li>
    <li>Pour in the reserved marinade, add bay leaves, and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li>Lower the heat, cover, and simmer for about 30–40 minutes or until the chicken is tender. Add water if the sauce reduces too much.</li>
    <li>Optional: Add brown sugar for a touch of sweetness and stir well.</li>
    <li>Uncover and continue to simmer until the sauce thickens to your desired consistency.</li>
    <li>Serve hot with steamed rice and enjoy!</li>
